The jupyter notebook containing training of LeNet-300-100 also serves as a good tutorial for any beginner to train a DNN using Tensorflow. The code is used to quantize the DNN model trained on MNIST and both the precisions FP32 and INT8 are saved.

The Inference notebook is used to measure the accuracy and the speed up of the FP32 model and quantized model.
